    <h1>Opening: We are!</h1>
    <p>
      The music "We are!" is the first oppening of One Piece and the most
      outstanding of the anime. It was composed by Kohei Tanaka, sung by Hiroshi
      Kitadani with lyrics written by Skoko Fujibayashi. The music was composed
      especially for the manga. It is considered as the main oppening of One
      Piece, it was used in all the arc of East Blue "first arc of one piece"
      but reappeared as an insert song for the first arc of the manga...

    <h1>One Piece Red</h1>
    <p>
      One Piece Red is the last movie released in the One Piece series and it is
      set after the events of the Wano arc. It was directed by Goro Taniguchi
      and was released in August 2022. The movie highlights a character that is
      very much appreciated by the consumers of One Piece which is Shanks the
      redhead, a pirate that we don't see much in the manga but that makes us
      feel a feeling of power when he is seen, he is one of the 4 emperors of
      One Piece...

    <h1>The increase in pollution</h1>
    <p>
      Nowadays, pollution is one of the biggest problems for the future of the
      planet that causes more and more deaths every year. Indeed, the number of
      deaths in 2021 is 9 million, a figure that is stratospheric caused by
      humans who self-destruct. The author of One Piece Oda created a whole arc
      about the creation of a whole industrial area on an island because of the

    <h1>The transmission of messages through manga</h1>
    <p>
      Manga is read for the positive messages it conveys. The stories are unique
      and are much more in-depth than a comic book that is around 50 pages long.
      They are often comical with a protagonist who is in the style of idiocy
      just like Luffy in One Piece who transmits positive emotions while keeping
      a story just as incredible with precisely the resumption of reality to
      transmit a message...
