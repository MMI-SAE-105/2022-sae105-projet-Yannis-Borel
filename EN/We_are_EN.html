    <h2>What does the music symbolize?</h2>
    <hr class="hracc_3">
    <p class="article">
        It is notably on several films of One Piece to remind the value
        of oppening: Joy. </p>
      <p class="article"> Indeed, the oppening of One Piece symbolizes
        the motivation and the achievement of our dreams. This corresponds
        exactly to the values of the animation. </p>
      <p class="article"> With a main character who
        unreal number of dreams, he shows us that everything is possible by doing everything
        doing everything to make them come true.

    <h2>The dream of the characters</h2>
    <p class="article">
        The first two sentences of the song "Let's gather all our dreams, and
        our desires" remind us once again that all the characters in One Piece
        One Piece characters have goals: Luffy, to be the freest man in the world by
        free man in the world by becoming the king of the pirates. </p>

    <p class="article">
        Each character has a dream and the lyrics remind us of this and
        and that pushes us to have our own goals and to do everything to achieve them, and
        and that's what we like about One Piece.
