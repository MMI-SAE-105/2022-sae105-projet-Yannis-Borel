    <h1>The transmission of messages through manga</h1>
    <p>
      Manga is read for the positive messages it conveys. The stories are unique
      and are much more in-depth than a comic book that is around 50 pages long.
      They are often comical with a protagonist who is in the style of idiocy

      a story just as incredible with precisely the resumption of reality to
      transmit a message...
