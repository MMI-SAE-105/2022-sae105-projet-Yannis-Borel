    <p class="article">
        I'm going to present you a manga which was released at the same time as One
        Piece. It is called Death Note. </p>
      <p class="article"> A unique story that has been remembered for its
        for its unique effectiveness. The story takes place
        takes place in only 37 episodes of 23 minutes in the animation. </p>
      <p class="article"> This makes
        one of the shortest manga of Japan at its release. But its universe is
        what makes the strength of the manga thanks to this notebook of death. </p>
      <p class="article"> In which
        these names are written in the book and are killed with a desired consequence
        and a desired date.

    <legend>Light with the god of death</legend>
    <p class="article">
        Its graphics are reminiscent of One Piece at its beginning. Indeed, the anime
        was released in 2006 but has a more than qualitative animation. What is
        very rare at that time.
    </p>
    <h2>Summary of Death Note</h2>
    <hr class="hracc_3">
    <p class="article">
        The manga tells the story of a very intelligent young high school student named Light
        Yagami. One day he finds the Death Notebook,
        he will have the powers of a "god". </p>
      <p class="article"> But a very smart investigator
        investigator named "L" will lead a long journey to find the criminal
        the criminal in question. This scene is quite powerful. </p>
      <p class="article"> Indeed,
        the spectator could wonder what he would do with this book in the place of
        instead of Light. </p>
      <p class="article"> Would we do as the protagonist and kill all the
        criminals in this world?
    </p>

    <h2>A story that immerses us in the animation</h2>
    <hr class="hracc_3">
    <p class="article">
        Death Note puts us directly in the story from the first episode and
        and shows us these two protagonists who both play with death but who are
        death but who are nevertheless gifted. </p>
      <p class="article"> The spectator has to make a choice between
        choice between the two camps: support Light and his supremacy or support L to find
        support L to find the culprit of all these deaths.
